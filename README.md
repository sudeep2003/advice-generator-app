## Overview

For the Frontend Mentor Advice generator app challenge, I created a Advice generator app that allows users to advice a message. The goal of this project was to practice building responsive and visually appealing components using HTML and CSS. I aimed to create a clean and user-friendly interface for generating advices.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on the following areas:

  - **1. JavaScript Interactivity:** Adding dynamic features to the QR code component, such as the ability to customize QR code content and download generated QR codes.<br>

  - **2. Accessibility:** Ensuring that the component is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
<br>

  - **3. Cross-browser Compatibility:** Testing the component on various web browsers and ensuring it works seamlessly on different platforms.
